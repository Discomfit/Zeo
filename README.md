# Zeo — The No AI Code IDE

Zeo is a modern Code IDE that focuses on great editing, navigation, and developer workflow without any built-in AI features, assistants, or telemetry-by-default.

## Why no AI?
Zeo is intentionally **AI Free**: no inline "copilot" suggestions, no model-backed chat, no AI extensions, and no code sent to third-party inference services as part of normal editing.

That means predictable behavior, fewer distractions, and a toolchain you fully control.

## Features

## Extension Policy

Zeo maintains a strict No AI policy across the entire ecosystem.

### What gets rejected
- Extensions that include AI-Powered features (code completion, chat, generation, etc.)
- Extensions with code that appears to be AI-Generated
- Extensions that phone home to AI services

### Review process
All extensions are manually reviewed by maintainers before acceptance. Violations result in:
1. Immediate rejection
2. Possible restriction from future submissions
3. Removal from the registry if discovered post-approval

### Why we do this
Zeo is a space for developers who want full control and transparency. AI-Generated code and AI tooling conflicts with that philosophy.
